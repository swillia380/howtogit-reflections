When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories mitigate the risk of data loss, allow you to access/commit from multiple computers, 
allows easy sharing and editing with other editors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically updating git could overwrite work currently being done in the local repository or make unexpected changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: a copy of another users git repository on github which cites the original author but allows the forker to make changes to the new copy; used to extend anothers work without editing their repository
clones: a local copy of a git repository allowing making changes on local computer, can be pulled to and pushed from a github repository; used for locally editing files
branches: new line of commits in the same repository; may be used for testing new features, experimental edits, or other changes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Allows editing/comparison of the last known state on your local computer and can be used without internet access
