When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories mitigate the risk of data loss, allow you to access/commit from multiple computers, 
allows easy sharing and editing with other editors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically updating git could overwrite work currently being done in the local repository or make unexpected changes.
